About me
=====
I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chunyi Peng](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chunyi/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) in 2019 and B.E. in Computer Science and Technology at [Northeastern University](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/) (Shenyang, China) in 2018.
